=====================================================================================
 REQUIREMENTS:
=====================================================================================

 This is a MWSE-Lua mod, and requires a valid installation of MWSE 2.1 or later.

    * Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon.
    * MGE-XE 0.10.0
    * MWSE 2.1

=====================================================================================
 ABOUT THIS MOD:
=====================================================================================

 This mod brings permadeath to Morrowind. The system is fairly simple. Whenever a
 new game starts, after entering the character's name, a prompt will ask if you want
 permadeath for the character.

 After configuring the number of lives to keep, the game will play as normal. Only,
 if your character dies any attempts to load a game with them will result in a
 message being displayed and a new game starting instead.

=====================================================================================
 INSTALLATION:
=====================================================================================

 Extract the archive into your Morrowind installation directory. The mod should
 contain the following file:
    .\Data Files\MWSE\mods\Permanently Perished\main.lua

=====================================================================================
 PLAYING THIS PLUGIN:
=====================================================================================

 There is no esp file to activate. Simply install the MWSE 2.1 and this mod, and
 load up an old or new game.
