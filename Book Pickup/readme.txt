 ABOUT THIS MOD:
=====================================================================================

 This simple mod makes you pick up books by default, instead of opening them. This
 can be changed by holding shift when activating the book.

 The default behavior can be restored in the mod config menu, in which case holding
 shift will pickup the book instead.

 contain the following files:
